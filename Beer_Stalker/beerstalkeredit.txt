I like the dark man, but for the icon it would be too busy with his arm, the !!!s and the beer glass along with the state the app is for;

Could we lose the arm, move him down a little, put the beer glass in the lower  right,
that way i could put TX, or CO (or any other state) over the glass. (so it looks like he is looking at the beer)

For the splash screen, im open to ideas to use the same dark man, peering around a bright beer tank  (search google for images of bright beer tank)  or corner, again searching for beer in tjhe distance

Looks great for a first cut!

Thanks!
